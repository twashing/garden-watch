# garden-watch

This is a leiningen plugin that just watches for changes to your [Garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) source files. ***"Garden is a library for rendering CSS in Clojure and ClojureScript"***.


## Usage


To use this plugin across your projects, put `[garden-watch "0.1.5"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your `:user` profile.

Or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install garden-watch 0.1.1`.

To install this plugin at a project level, put `[garden-watch "0.1.1"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

You can set this configuration `{:garden-watch {:input-dir "in/" :output-dir "out/"}}` in your project.clj. Then you can just call the plugin like so.

    $ lein garden-watch


Or you can just pass in those parameters directly. This also acts as an override to the configured values.

    $ lein garden-watch :input-dir in/ :output-dir out/
